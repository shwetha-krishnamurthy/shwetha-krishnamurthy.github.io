          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <p>
            Hi! I'm Shwetha - a curious human who spends way too much time thinking about AI systems and 
            occasionally remembers she's trained in Carnatic music for 14 years. Currently hanging out at 
            Chicago Booth/UChicago CS, where I'm supposedly getting two degrees but really just enjoying the 
            chance to dive deep into whatever catches my interest (these days it's mostly GenAI, but ask me again next week).
          </p>
          <p>
            When I'm not procrastinating on assignments by building random websites (like this one!), you 
            might find me trying to teach myself piano, co-chairing Booth's AI Group (which mostly involves
             convincing other students that AI is both cool and weird), or attempting to explain to my 
             friends why I find database architectures genuinely exciting. I've done some cool stuff with companies 
             like NVIDIA and Goldman Sachs, but honestly, I'm just here to learn interesting things and maybe make some 
             AI systems a bit more user-friendly along the way. Unless you're a classical music enthusiast, in which case forget AI - 
             let's talk about that instead!
